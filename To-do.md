# Pokemon-Unity-Essentials-2D
An open source framework for making fangames

Things currently working on:
Playing audio files (figure out how to handle fade-ins/outs for bgs, etc)
Day/Night cycle

Possible ideas:
Handling metadata for maps (write an external editor that will edit an XML file.  XML file is based on the scenes in your project folder.  
  These will be handled with a static class that reads them, and various other scripts will use this information [such as being indoors, for the day/night cycle)
Handling terrain tags, and their organization (overwrite editor aspects maybe?)

Haven't started:
Pause Menu
Other player animations (running, surfing, bike)
Battle System (hardest part)
Othere scenes (bag, party, etc)
Reading/writing pokemon data, and then using that data in game
Same for the bag
Way more than I want to list
