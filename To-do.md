# Pokemon-Unity-Essentials-2D

An open source framework for making fangames

Done:

Player Movement (basic movement)

Passability checks (basic check for colliders)

General Audio functions (play/switch BGM, BGS, SE, and Cries)

Day/Night Shader (need better shading colors)

Grid based player movement

NPC character animations (generated based on charset, no need for attatching animations.  Don't know if walking animations work yet, since NPCs can't walk)

Metadata handled by scripts attatched to the objects that hold each map

A watcher that determines when map changes are made

Metadata changes implemented upon map change


Things currently working on:
Audio fade in/out capabilities


Possible ideas:

Handling terrain tags, and their organization (overwrite editor aspects maybe?)



Haven't started:
Pause Menu
Other player animations (running, surfing, bike)
Battle System (hardest part)
Other scenes (bag, party, etc)
Reading/writing pokemon data, and then using that data in game
Same for the bag
Way more than I want to list
