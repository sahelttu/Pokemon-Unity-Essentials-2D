# Pokemon-Unity-Essentials-2D

An open source framework for making fangames

Done:

Player Movement (basic movement)

Passability checks (basic check for colliders)

General Audio functions (play/switch BGM, BGS, SE, and Cries)

Day/Night Shader (need better shading colors)

Grid based player movement

NPC character animations (generated based on charset, no need for attatching animations.  Don't know if walking animations work yet, since NPCs can't walk)


Things currently working on:
Audio fade in/out capabilities


Possible ideas:

Make Metadata objects all sub-objects of Metadata (for better organization.  A singular Metadata gameobject is created with a click.  In it are all the metadata options.  Upon loading the scene, all the other objects are generated based on these settings)

Handling terrain tags, and their organization (overwrite editor aspects maybe?)

Haven't started:
Pause Menu
Other player animations (running, surfing, bike)
Battle System (hardest part)
Other scenes (bag, party, etc)
Reading/writing pokemon data, and then using that data in game
Same for the bag
Way more than I want to list
